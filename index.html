            <ul class="py-4">
                <li>Satyajit Ray was born to Sukumar Ray and Suprabha Ray in Calcutta (now Kolkata).
                    Sukumar Ray died when Satyajit was two years old. Ray grew up in the house of his grandfather,
                    Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhury, and of his printing press. </li>

                <li>Ray studied at Ballygunge Government High School in Calcutta, and completed his BA in economics at
                    Presidency College, Calcutta. During his schooldays.</li>

                <li>His mother's persuasiveness and his respect for Tagore finally convinced him to get admitted there
                    for higher studies in Fine Art. In Santiniketan, Ray came to appreciate Oriental art. </li>

            <ul class="py-4">
                <li>In 1961, on the insistence of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Ray was commissioned to make
                    Rabindranath Tagore, based on the poet of the same name, on the occasion of his birth centennial, a
                    tribute to the person who likely most influenced Ray. Due to limited footage of Tagore, Ray was
                    challenged by the necessity of making the film mainly with static material. He said that it took as
                    much work as three feature films. </li>

                <li>Ray's first film, Pather Panchali, won eleven international prizes, including Best Human Documentary
                    at the Cannes Film Festival. This film, Aparajito, and Apur Sansar form The Apu Trilogy. Ray did the
                    scripting, casting, scoring, and editing, and designed his own credit titles and publicity material.
                </li>

                <li> The Government of India honoured him with the Bharat Ratna in 1992. </li>

                <li>Ray's international career started in earnest after the success of his next film, the second in The
                    Apu Trilogy, Aparajito (1956) (The Unvanquished). This film depicts the eternal struggle between
                    the ambitions of a young man, Apu, and the mother who loves him. Upon release, Aparajito won the
                    Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, bringing Ray considerable acclaim. </li>

                <li>In 1978, he was awarded an honorary degree by Oxford University.FFI 53 - the annual film festival
